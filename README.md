This is my first Machine Learning project, which predicts whether a person is going to have diabetes or not. 
You would find below a django app , csv files, jupyter notebook.
Note: you have to run following commands:
pip3 install django
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install virtualenv  
pip3 install matplotlib     
   
Make sure you update the location of the "diabetes.csv" on the  file "views.py" according to your    
location and then use   
python manage.py runserver  
  
I used vscode as an IDE and anaconda to run the jupyer notebook
Those are screenshots of how the application appears to the user
