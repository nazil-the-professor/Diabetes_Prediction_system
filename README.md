This is my first Machine Learning project ehich predict a person is going to have diabetes or not. You would find below a django app , csv files, jupyter notebook.
Note: you have to run following commands:
pip3 install django
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install virtualenv
pip3 install matplotlib

Make sure you update the location of the "diabetes.csv" on the file "views.py" according to your location and then use
python manage.py runserver

I used vscode as an IDE and anaconda to run the jupyer notebook
Those are screenshots of how the application appears to the user
